    <h2>My Story</h2>
    <h3>Hello!</h3>
    <p>Hi there! My name is Jay, and I'm so glad to have you here on my website! Honestly, I'm not the best at talking about myself, but the best way to improve is to just do it! So that's what I'm going to try to do!</p>
    <p>I was born in a log cabin in the middle of a blizzard... Just kidding! </p>
    <p>I took a Visual Basic programming course my senior year of high school. I didn't really need it, I only really needed English, Social Studies and Gym, but my friends were taking it and it seemed interesting. I'm glad I took that class. While the initial course was only half a year, I decided to do the second half, with only 4 other people, my friends Emily, Parshva, and Scott and the German foreign exchange student, I believe his name is Heinrich. That class ignighted a love for programming, logic and problem-solving that has not gone out to this day.</p>
    <p>That same year, I took AP Statistics with Mr. Kenny. Mr Kenny was widely know at my high school for being the best math teacher, like, ever. That, coupled with the year an AP class normally takes, as opposed to the 4 months of a college semester, lead to a richer and deeper understanding of statistics that has served me well over my acedemic career.</p>
    <p>If you spend any more than an hour with me, it will become incresingly apparent that I have little to no self confidence, and that any belief that you might have had otherwise was due to a false front carefully crafted over years of bs-ing. I enjoyed art in high school, and wanted to do something along those lines in college. (It should be noted that this has nothing to do with what I wanted to do with my life.) However, I did not have the mental tenacity to actually submit my work for a portfolio. So I applied to the one 4-year SUNY school that doesn't need a portfolio review to get into their art program, SUNY Oneonta.</p>
    <p>Once there, I knew I was going to double major - Computer Art and Computer Science. This wasn't that hard - this was a liberal arts school. </p>
    <p>TBC...</p>
