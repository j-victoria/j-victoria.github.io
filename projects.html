    <h2>Projects</h2>
    <h3>Pipelined Processor Simulator</h3>
    <p>Using C++, my team built a simulator of a pipelined CPU with multiple function units which implemented out of order processing. I was responsible for several components such as the unified issue queue and the wake-up & issue logic as well as the reorder buffer and retirement & interrupt handling.</p>
    <h3>Location-Bound Business Review System</h3>
    <p>My team used an agile & Ruby on Rails approach to build a webapp that validated reviews of a business by the location of the user. I developed over half of the features, full stack, including business analytics and most of the location system.</p>
    <h3>Message Queue Implementation</h3>
    <p>I created a message queue library in C for both posix threads & separate processes. Both synchronous and asynchronous messaging was implemented using mutexes & condition variables. </p>
